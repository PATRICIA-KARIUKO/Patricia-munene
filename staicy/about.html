          <h2>Innovative Way To Learn</h2>
          <p>
            Being a successful software engineer is more than just coding solo
            at a computer. The most successful engineers make their impact
            through brainstorming with peers, sharing techniques, pitching
            ideas, writing technical articles, and organizing meetups. In fact,
            Google recently found the seven top characteristics of success at
            Google are all soft skills. Our project-based curriculum pushes our
            students for better communication and teamwork, and our events,
            meetups, and talks help our students hone interviewing skills,
            tackle coding challenges, attend events with industry insiders, and
            more.
          </p>

            Project-based learning is a proven, alternative learning methodology
            to the traditional teacher-led lecture and memorization educational
            method. Rather than teaching a lot of theory and having students
            occasionally apply a fraction of their knowledge on a class project,
            we do the opposite. We give our students increasingly difficult
            programming challenges to solve with minimal initial directions on
            how to solve them. As a result, our students learn to look for the
            theory and tools they need, how to understand them, how to apply
            them, and how to work as a team.
